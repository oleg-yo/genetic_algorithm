## Traveling salesman problem
This algorithm finds the shortest way to bypass all given cities (points in 2d space).
---
Gen - it's a city with its coordinates.
Chromosome - it's one possible way to bypass all points.
Generation - it's one iteration of algorithm, that has set of individuals with different overall way length.

On every iteration genetic algorithm does selection, crossingover and mutation to create the next generation.
